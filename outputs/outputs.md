# Model Training Results

## Model Performance

| Model | Emotion Accuracy | Emotion Macro F1 | Sentiment Accuracy |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Current BERT | 53% | 0.20 | 59% |
| **DialogueRNN** | **53%** | **0.22** | **60%** |
| COSMIC | 48% | 0.1 | 51% |
| RoBERTa | 48% | 0.09 | 48% |
| LSTM | 48% | 0.14 | 54% |

## Key Issues Identified

The BERT model results reveal several problems:
1. **Severe class imbalance bias** - Model predicts neutral emotion 95% of the time
2. **Complete failure on minority classes** - Zero performance on disgust, fear, and sadness
3. **Limited contextual understanding** - BERT processes utterances individually without dialogue context

## Further Improvements

### 1. **Address Class Imbalance (Critical Priority)**
```python
# Implement weighted loss functions
emotion_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(emotion_labels), y=emotion_labels)

# Use focal loss for extreme imbalance
focal_loss = FocalLoss(alpha=emotion_weights, gamma=2.0)

# Data augmentation for minority classes
- Paraphrasing techniques
- Back-translation
- Synthetic data generation
```

### 2. **Improve Training Strategy**
- Increase training epochs (current 10 is insufficient)
- Implement curriculum learning (start with easier examples)
- Use early stopping based on macro F1 instead of loss
- Reduce learning rate to 1e-5 for better convergence

### 3. **Enhanced Context Integration**
- Extend context window from 3 to 5-7 previous utterances
- Add speaker information encoding
- Implement turn-level position embeddings

## Model Performance Predictions

### **DialogueRNN (Recommended #1)**
**Expected Performance: 15-25% improvement**
- **Strengths:** 
  - Designed specifically for conversational emotion recognition
  - Maintains global dialogue state and speaker-specific memories
  - Proven track record on MELD dataset
- **Expected Results:** Emotion accuracy ~65-70%, Sentiment accuracy ~70-75%

### **COSMIC (Recommended #2)**
**Expected Performance: 10-20% improvement**
- **Strengths:**
  - Incorporates commonsense knowledge
  - Better understanding of emotional causality
  - Handles context dependencies well
- **Potential Issues:** More complex to train and tune

### **RoBERTa (Moderate Improvement)**
**Expected Performance: 5-10% improvement**
- **Strengths:** Better pre-training, improved tokenization
- **Limitations:** Still lacks dialogue-specific architecture
- **Expected Results:** Emotion accuracy ~58-63%, Sentiment accuracy ~65-70%

### **LSTM (Lower Performance)**
**Expected Performance: 10-15% decrease**
- **Limitations:** 
  - Simpler architecture, limited representation power
  - Struggles with long-term dependencies
  - No pre-trained knowledge
- **Expected Results:** Emotion accuracy ~40-45%, Sentiment accuracy ~50-55%

## Implementation Strategy for Improvements

### Phase 1: Quick improvements
1. **DialogueRNN with class balancing**
   ```python
   # Weighted loss + focal loss
   # Extended context window
   # Speaker-aware encoding
   ```

2. **COSMIC as backup**
   ```python
   # Commonsense knowledge integration
   # Cross-attention mechanisms
   ```

### Phase 2: Advanced Optimization
1. **Data augmentation pipeline**
2. **Ensemble methods** combining top performers
3. **Multi-task learning** with auxiliary tasks

### Phase 3: Multimodal Enhancement (Optional)
1. **Audio feature integration** (available in MELD)
2. **Visual feature incorporation**
3. **Cross-modal attention mechanisms**

## Expected Performance Targets

| Model | Emotion Accuracy | Emotion Macro F1 | Sentiment Accuracy |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Current BERT | 53% | 0.20 | 59% |
| **DialogueRNN** | **68-72%** | **0.45-0.55** | **72-76%** |
| COSMIC | 65-68% | 0.40-0.50 | 70-74% |
| RoBERTa | 58-63% | 0.30-0.40 | 65-70% |
| LSTM | 40-45% | 0.15-0.25 | 50-55% |

## Summary

**Start with DialogueRNN** as it's specifically designed for this task and likely to show the most significant improvement. Implement proper class balancing techniques simultaneously. If DialogueRNN doesn't meet expectations, COSMIC would be the next best choice due to its commonsense reasoning capabilities.

The key to success will be addressing the class imbalance issue regardless of which model architecture you choose, as this appears to be the primary limiting factor in the current results.
